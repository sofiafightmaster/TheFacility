# The Facility
This is a digital narrative written on Twine by Sofia Fightmaster.
[Updated July 18 @ 2:35pm] A new draft of this narrative is in progress. The new interactive fiction will introduce more of a video game feeling where the readers goes into different rooms to track the different sides of the story. It will be more immersive because the readers types their name and chooses preferred pronouns to be referred to by the other characters. The reader will have more of an opportunity to understand the different sides of the story in this new version and the pacing has been fleshed out. Rough draft of this to be published before August. At that time I will write a longer description here.
