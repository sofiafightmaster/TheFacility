# The Facility
This is a digital narrative written on Twine by Sofia Fightmaster.
In this narrative, the reader or player goes through the story as one of twelve archetypal characters one at a time until all of the perspectives of the story have been processed.
# Collection
The player adds to the collection as the story progresses and as each perspective is experienced. There are a total of 47 symbols to collect. The symbols include seasons, elementals, symbols, inertia, house name, Soul trinity, intelligence and astrological signs as described in the story's introduction.
The player must experience each character's perspective to collect all 47 symbols and to complete the story. The end of the story will bring the player back to choose a new character. The only way to know that the story is complete is to notice that each link has been clicked.
There are some pieces of the story hidden in the Collection. After symbols have been collected such as any of the ReMemories or house names, the player can access the Collection and click to view displayed text about eah collected symbol. Most of these displayed texts, however, will remind the player how they have collected the symbol.
# Significant Points
The author uses capitalization to emphasize certain words in the world of The Facility and to make these common nouns into what the characters understand to be proper nouns. Words like "Soul" and "Them" are capitalized to show that in The Facility, these things are specific and refer to something exact. At times the word might be uncapitalized by a character in dialogue, for example, because they don't understand the emphasis The Facility holds to words like "Them".
